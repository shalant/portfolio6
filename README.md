## Portfolio6
Newest portfolio, with lots of custom css

# I added a lot of features. Besides standard portfolio elements, I embedded a weather app in the upper left hand corner (WeatherWidget) and managed to successfully re-orient the css to make it work within the page. Notably, it features an API call to openweathermap.org.

## Next Steps

# I will eventually make a new portfolio trying some original/modern UI. I have neglected that in my studies thus far, and I would like to take a deep dive.
