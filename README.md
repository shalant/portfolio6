# Portfolio6
Newest portfolio, with lots of custom css

## I added a lot of features. Besides standard portfolio elements, I embedded a weather app in the upper left hand corner (WeatherWidget) and managed to successfully re-orient the css to make it work within the page. Notably, it features an API call to openweathermap.org.
